# Private notebook files

I'm impressed notebook of ipython, called jupyter now. I would try to introduce my work flow to improve my jobs. so I created some samples using notebook. then I would present the files as sample using nbviewer. :smile:  
[top-level of samples](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/morishin8838/nbviewer/blob/master/index.ipynb)

next, I introduced nbviewer server in local, so  I would present my procedure in this repo.

## Procesure of publishment via nbviewer
1. push the ipynb files to github
    e.g  (https://github.com/morishin8838/nbviewer/index.ipynb)
2. access the ipynb file via nbviewer
    e.g  (http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/morishin8838/nbviewer/blob/master/index.ipynb)
3. you can download files above button.

## Set up nbviewer server for local opparation.
if you want to operate nbserver internally,
