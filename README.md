# Private notebook files

I'm impressed notebook of ipython, called jupyter now.  I would try to introduce my work flow to improve my jobs. so I create some samples using notebook. then I would present files as samples using nbviwer as here.  
[top-level of samples](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/morishin8838/nbviewer/blob/master/index.ipynb)
:smile:
and I try to introduce nbviewer local server. I would note my proccedure in this repo.

## Procesure of publishment via nbviewer
1. push the ipynb files to github
    e.g  (https://github.com/morishin8838/nbviewer/index.ipynb)
2. access the ipynb file via nbviewer
    e.g  (http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/morishin8838/nbviewer/blob/master/index.ipynb)
3. you can download files above button.

## Set up nbviewer server for local opparation.
if you want to operate nbserver internally, 

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
